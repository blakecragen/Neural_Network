    "When computing gradients, we travel backwards from the loss all the way back ot the input. We first seek to obtain the derivative of the loss $l$ with respect to the logits $u_2$. Note that they have the relation $$ l = \\text{cross\\_entropy}(\\text{softmax}(u_2))$$. Computing the derivative of this seems very involved, but it actually has a very elegant result: $$ \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial u_2} = \\text{softmax}(u_2) - y = \\hat{y} - y. $$ While this is given to you, we encourage you to derive it for yourself! You can find a great explanation of the derivation [in this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/derivative-of-the-softmax-function-and-the-categorical-cross-entropy-loss-ffceefc081d1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have $\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial u_2}$, we seek to move further back and compute $\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\theta_2}$ and $\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial b_2}$. This is done using the chain rule:\n",

    "\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\theta_2} &= \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial u_2} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial \\theta_2} \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantities $\\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial \\theta_2}$ and $\\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial b_2}$ are easy to derive from the relation $u_2 = \\theta_2 o_1 + b_2$. We see that\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\theta_2} &= \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial u_2} \\cdot o_1 \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial b_2} &= \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial u_2} \\cdot 1.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the derivative involves $o_1$, which we computed during the forward pass. Fortunately, we saved that value in `self.cache`, so we don't need to compute it again!\n",
    "\n",
    "The same procedure is repeated to obtain the gradients for the upstream parameters $\\theta_1$ and $b_1$. We must first perform the intermediate steps of computing the derivative of the loss with respect to $o_1$ and then $u_1$. These are given by\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second relation, we must consider our use of dropout! If we applied dropout on a particular neuron, it should not be adjusted. To account for this, in the case of `use_dropout=True`, we must instead use $$ \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial u_1} = \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial o_1} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial\\,\\text{leaky\\_relu}}{\\partial u_1} \\cdot \\text{dropout\\_mask} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1-p}, $$ where $1 / (1-p)$ is the scaling factor and dropout_mask is stored in `self.cache`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step! We can use these values to compute the gradients for $\\theta_1$ and $b_1$, using the relation $u_1 = \\theta_1 X + b_1$, which are given by\n",

But, as this gradient keeps flowing backwards to the initial layers, this value keeps getting multiplied by each local gradient. Hence, the gradient becomes smaller and smaller, making the updates to the initial layers very small, increasing the training time considerably.\n",

    "## 3.3 Plotting Feature Importance [1.1% Bonus for All] <span style=\"color:green\">**[W]**</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "While building tree-based models, it's common to quantify how well splitting on a particular feature in an extra tree helps with predicting the target label in a dataset. Machine learning practicioners typically use \"Gini importance\", or the (normalized) total reduction in entropy brought by that feature to evaluate how important that feature is for predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini importance is typically calculated as the reduction in entropy from reaching a split in an extra tree weighted by the probability of reaching that split in the extra tree. Sklearn internally computes the probability for reaching a split by finding the total number of samples that reaches it during the training phase divided by the total number of samples in the dataset. This weighted value is our feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about what this metric means with an example. A high probabiity of reaching a split on feature A in an extra tree trained on a dataset (many samples will reach this split for a decision) and a large reduction in entropy from splitting on feature A will result in a high feature importance value for feature A. This could mean feature A is a very important feature for predicting the probability of the target label. On the other hand, a low probability of reaching a split on feature B in an extra tree and a low reduction in entropy from splitting on feature B will result in a low feature importance value. This could mean feature B is not a very informative feature for predicting the target label. **Thus, the higher the feature importance value, the more important the feature is to predicting the target label.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, fitting a sklearn.ExtraTreeClassifier to a dataset automatically computes the Gini importance for every feature in the extra tree and stores these values in a **feature_importances\\_** variable. [Review the docs for more details on how to access this variable](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.ExtraTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.ExtraTreeClassifier.feature_importances_)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the <strong>random_forest.py</strong> file, complete the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <strong>plot_feature_importance</strong>: Make sure to sort the bars in descending order and remove any features with feature importance of 0\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, call your implementation of `plot_feature_importance()` and display a bar plot that shows the feature importance values for at least one extra tree in your tuned random forest from Q3.2.\n"
